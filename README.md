# VisualChessRanking
Here will list the major goals of the project

The near-perfected ELO system of Lichess and chess.com will always be the better determiner of individual player skill. However the tiers should be, at the very least, a good indicator of where your overall player skill sits with the rest of the players on lichess or chess.com for each variant. The tiers should also be represented through a visual indicator (i.e. a “rank image”)
